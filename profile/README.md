## ⚡ Zom Language
Zom is a Ahead Of Time compiled programming language, the code generation and compilation is made with LLVM. 

- **Ahead of Time** compiled programmaing language, that mean you will have great performance, because the transformation of the source code to assembly is done before. Contrary to Just In Time compilation who's occur at the same time as the execution.
- **Statically typed**, Zom solves types at compile time, and not at run time.
- **Performance**, because Zom is Ahead of Time compiled, all the hard work is done before the execution. And because Zom uses LLVM, a bunch of optimization is made at compile-time.
- **Safety and Simplicity**, Zom is safe and simple at the same time, because it doesn't have a very strict design.
- **Memory managment**, Zom use static analysis and a system inspired by the Rust Borrow checker.
